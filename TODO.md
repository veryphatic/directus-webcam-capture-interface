# Bugs

-----------------------------------------

Issue:
Sometimes after I reload the extension and I refresh the browser while looking at a entry with a known set of items previously saved; the UI indicates there are no item and doesn't present any information.

Cause:
I think I need to add a watch on the `value` to ensure when the api returns the data it's processed

Fix:
Put a watch on props `primaryKey` which is returning `+` initially, and there was nothing triggering a reload if the other components had already mounted.


-----------------------------------------

Issue:
When the item with thumbnails is open and the user doesn't interact with the app for a while, 
When the thumbnail is clicked the image is not fetched and there is a 401 error.

Cause:
The method of fetching was based on reusing a token after fetching the image. The token was expiring. 

Fix:
Use the Axois instance to fetch the image and use a bas64 string as the image source

[x] fixed

-----------------------------------------

Issue:
Directus isn't noticing when a change is made to the file object (title, description) on a saved image

Cause:
I've implemented the update in the `useRelatedImages` hook by directly mutating the values using the File API. Where it should insted be sent as an `update` property:

```json
{
    {
    "create": [],
    "update": [
        {
            "directus_files_id": {
                "description": "ðŸ¤¦!",
                "id": "e0bc33ee-0353-4e08-90e8-42a4ed70d67d"
            },
            "id": 39
        }
    ],
    "delete": []
}
}

Fix:


[] fixed
